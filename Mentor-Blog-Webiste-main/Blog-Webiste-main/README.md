# Blog Website

Welcome to the repository of a blog website built using Express, EJS, Node.js, Mongoose, and CSS. This website allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts using MongoDB. The blog website is connected to MongoDB Atlas for seamless data storage and retrieval. Additionally, the website is hosted on Render for reliable and scalable hosting.

## Features

- **Blog Creation**: Users can create new blog posts by visiting the "/compose" URL and adding their content using a user-friendly editor.
- **Blog Listing**: All blog posts are listed on the home page, allowing visitors to browse and read articles at their convenience.
- **Full Window View**: Clicking on individual blog posts opens them in a separate full window, providing an immersive reading experience.
- **CRUD Functionality**: The website supports CRUD operations for managing blog posts, allowing users to edit or delete their own posts.
- **Search by Title**: Users can search for specific blog posts by adding the title to the end of the URL, providing a quick way to find relevant content.
